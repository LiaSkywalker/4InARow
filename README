Hi :)
This is my final exercise from "introduction to computer science" course.
In this code I created a 4 In A Row game.
The game is run from the file "four_in_a_row.py"
Hope you will enjoy it!

==================
=  Description:  =
==================
this directory include the file
four_in_a_row.py
README

files directory:
gui.py
game.py
ai.py
and all the pictures for the game

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
the game start running in four_in_a_row.py file.
when the running starts- a screen of the game type selection is created.
after that- the user choice is updated in the game class, and the game screen is created.

the ai method is called while ai player take turn.
the logic of ai class running is simple- choose a random column, and check if it legal.
if it legal- return the column. else, choose another column.

class content:
*Game- functions of the logic of the board. check legal placing,
the players configuartion and more..
*Opening_menu- create the opening menu, and take selection from the user
*Game_menu- create the game menu, and run the game during the given configuration.
